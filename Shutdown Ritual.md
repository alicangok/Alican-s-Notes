A “Shutdown ritual”, as proposed by Cal Newport in the [[Work deeply]] chapter of his book [[Deep Work]] (and [blog](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/)) does 3 things:
- Helps me “turn off” and stop thinking about work  
- Prompts me to celebrate my progress  
- Lays the groundwork for another productive day
