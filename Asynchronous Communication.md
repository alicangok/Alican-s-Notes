In [[Digital Minimalism]], Cal Newport advocates shifting social life from "connection" back to "conversation", but notes that the major obstacle is the degree to which we use text communication (whatsapp) almost defines friendships. 

He suggests checking text messages during predetermined times, hence text messaging becomes like emails, an asynchronous mode of communication.

However, being less available over text can paradoxically strengthen your relationship, as both sides will be more motivated to fill this void with better interaction, and you can become the one person in their life who actually *talks* with them on a regular basis, forming a deeper relationship.

This being said, notify people of your new communication preference, and they can always call you, or schedule offline/online meetings.

The following is a little too extreme, but here's [Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html) on why he doesn't even use e-mail:

> Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration. I try to learn certain areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try to digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don't have time for such study.
> On the other hand, I need to communicate with thousands of people all over the world as I write my books. I also want to be responsive to the people who read those books and have questions or comments. My goal is to do this communication efficiently, in batch mode --- like, one day every six months.
