### PCA:

- linear dimensionality reduction
- preserve global structure
- no hyperparameters
- deterministic
- works by rotating vectors for preserving variance
- we can decide on how much variance to preserve using eigenvalues

### t-SNE:

- non-linear technique
- preserves local structure, clusters
- few hyperparameters
- non-deterministic (randomised)
- tries to minimize distance between points using a gaussian distribution
