Believing that there's a magical right job out there can lead to chronic unhappiness, when the reality of the world fails to match this dream.

Steve Jobs' passion speech is bullshit. He had to quit his "zen" passion and focus on what earned him money to become successful: "Yaptığını yap, dediğini yapma"

Career passions are rare, they take time, they are a side effect of mastery. As you build the autonomy, competence and relatedness in your work, the passion will naturally arise (see [[Self-Determination Theory]]).

Following your passion is dangerously optimistic, it yields a career with confusion, unsatisfaction and angst.

Similar to how asking ourselves about the meaning of life (and pursuing that) is pointless (see [[Man's Search for Meaning#^dc85d1|this main theme in Man's Search for Meaning]]), trying to blindly follow an idealized passion for career success is flawed. The pursuit can lead to chronic unsatisfaction and anxiety, and when finally reached, it can result in the the crumbling of the passion. Instead of following your passion, let the passion follow you in your quest, just like taking responsibility in fulfilling tasks forms the meaning of life itself.
