### Internet Usage

Once the brain is wired for distraction, it craves it. We need to rewire the brain so that it's better suited to staying on task. A full on internet sabbath (discrete detox day/week), isn't effective. Instead, schedule occasional breaks from focus. In your schedule, mostly allocate time where you aren't allowed to use the internet, with periods in between where you can.

> Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.

If you are stuck and need to consult the internet, take note of it, and do so in the "break" time. Resist the temptation to quickly look up the information and return. These exceptions fill result in your brain to treat the barrier between internet and offline ans permeable, killing the benefits of this strategy.

Make sure that you schedule the offline vs. internet usage even for hours after work. This will further improve your concentration training.

Note that the idea of internet blocking is not necessarily to reduce the total amount of online time. Rather, it is to teach your brain to resist switching to the distractions at the smallest hint of boredom. Therefore, it is safe to schedule lots of internet-allowed blocks. Just make sure to respect the offline blocks. 

### Meditate Productively

A few times per week, schedule productive meditations: Focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem when you're walking/jogging/driving/taking a shower.

The task may be to outline an article, write a talk, make progress on a proof.

Just like in mindfulness meditation, be wary of the distractions and looping. Try to redirect your attention to the next step. Employ the "mise en place" principle, store the relevant variables in memory, and ask yourself the next-step questions.
