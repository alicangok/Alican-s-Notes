Think small: Focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a long time, reach the cutting edge
Act big: Discover a mission, go after it with enthusiasm.

Mission is a trait that defines compelling careers. Note that you can only realistically think about your mission after you have built mastery in your field, after you reached the cutting edge, otherwise you're bound to fail. Just like scientific contributions are usually found in the "Adjacent possible" of the current understanding, the best ideas for career missions are found in this space, just beyond the cutting edge. 

Once you identify a general mission, an effective strategy to succeed in your mission is to try **small steps/bets** with concrete feedback, then use the feedback to alter your approach systematically. These little bets should not take more than a few months to try. (similar to the "Exploration vs exploitation" tradeoff reinforcement learning). Another strategy is through adopting a marketing mindset: Your mission must compel people to remark about it, and you need to launch this in a venue to help such remarking (better journals, open source software, youtube). Through these strategies, you can transform your vision from a compelling idea into a compelling career.
