This is a theory of human motivation in the absence of external influences.

According to this, motivation requires three basic psychological needs:
- Autonomy: The feeling that you're in control, and that your actions matter.
- Competence: The feeling that you are good at what you do.
- Relatedness: Connecting with other people, caring for others.
