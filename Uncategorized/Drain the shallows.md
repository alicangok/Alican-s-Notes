Schedule every minute of your day. This will give you conscious control over how you spend your 16 hours, helping you treat your time with respect. Otherwise, we're on autopilot, following the path of the least resistance, and shallowness fills most of our time. Some tips:

- Schedule the day in 30 minute blocks.
- In case the estimates are wrong, and you are lagging, revise the schedule. If needed, reschedule some tasks to later days (during your shutdown ritual). The important idea is not to follow the schedule at all costs, it is to maintain a thoughtful say in how I'm spending my time going forward.
- Employ "overflow conditional blocks". If tasks are finished early, have alternate non-urgent tasks to be put in schedule.
- It is perfectly acceptable that if you stumble onto an important insight, you can clear the next few items focus on it. Just make sure to rebuilt the schedule once it is over. To reiterate: the schedule is not about constraint, it is about thoughtfulness. Do not be afraid of the schedule, and overcome your distrust of structure.

Another useful practice is to quantify the depth of every activity. Ask yourself whether a college-graduate can easily learn to do the task, or whether the task indeed requires your years of expertise or skill. Try to bias your time towards the more cognitively demanding, deep tasks.

Try to have a fixed-schedule, and finish your work by a preset time. The author of this book was probably an early bird, and he set this time as 5.30 PM, but I can probably shift this by an hour or so. Through your shutdown ritual, free your mind from work obligations, so that in the evening, you can freely relax with well-thought satisfying hobbies or activities.
