From a [summary](https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-range-why-generalists-triumph-in-a-specialized-world/)

- **Head-starts are overrated**: There are a lot of late-bloomers
- To solve **complex problems in a wicked world**, you need abstraction for problem solving. It’s crucial to learn _how_ to think (not just _what_ to think).
- Less of the same is more: The **role of wide-sampling** in learning, discovery and innovation.
- **Fast vs slow learning**: Slow, through [[Be so good they can't ignore you|deliberate practice]]. Embrace discomfort.
- When **tackling never-seen-before situations**, incorporate outside views and apply deep analogical thinking to understand an unfamiliar problem.
- **Know when to quit** (and when to persevere): Late-specialization isn’t bad, and grit isn’t always good. 
- **Experiment to discover your possible selves**: [[Think small, act big#^ce3292|Small bets]] rather than following a fixed, long-term plan.
- **Tap on the outsider advantage**. Outsiders can facilitate discoveries.
- **Combine breadth and depth** for maximum creativity.
- **Don’t be fooled by expertise**. Improve your forecasting abilities.
- **Know when to drop familiar tools**: Consider missing data and the danger of regressing to habitual responses under pressure.
- **Be a deliberate amateur**. The most creative thinkers have a playful streak that allows them to explore freely and transcend conventional boundaries.

For learning strategies:
- Inverleaving: Mix topics, instead of studying in sequential blocks
- Spaced repetition
- Generation effect: Test yourself, generate answers on your own. The most effective learning happens when an answer you’re confident about turns out to be wrong.
