Similar to a major theme in [[Atomic Habits]],  you have a finite amount of willpower, it is like a muscle that tires. You need well formed habits (routines and rituals) to minimize the dependence on the willpower, and maintain the state of undistracted concentration. The following strategies will increase the probability of the deep work habit sticking and becoming a part of your life:

1. Decide on the Depth philosophy
    - For me, I decided that the bimodal philosophy is most suitable. Dedicate a clearly defined part of your week/semester to deep pursuits. The minimum unit of time is one full day.
2. Ritualize:
    - Again, this draws parallels with the "[[Make It Obvious]]" rule in [[Atomic Habits]].
    - "Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants"
    - Decide on:
        - Where you'll work, for how long?
        - How you'll work (internet use allowed? tracking metric for motivation?)
        - How you'll support your work? (food? coffee? exercise? organize table?)
3. Make grand gestures: ^7cf884
    - By making a radical change to your normal environment, you increase the perceived importance of the deep work task. This increases motivation and reduces procrastination.
    - Retreat to a cabin? Buy an expensive notebook
4. Don't work alone:
    - Expose yourself to others' ideas on a regular basis. Push each other to even deeper levels.
5. Execute like a business: 
    - The principles in the famous business book "4 Disciplines of Execution" apply to personal work as well, by bridging "how to do it" (often unclear) & "what to do" (clearly known)
    - Focus on the wildly important (a.k.a 80/20, Pareto principle)
        - Say "yes" to the important stuff
    - Act on the lead measures (as opposed to lag measures, such as publications)
        - Focus on hours put in to deep work
    - Keep a compelling scoreboard ^f1cc1d
        - Tape a card next to the monitor to track progress (each hour of deep work is a tick, each row is a week)
    - Create a cadence of accountability ^6878b3
        - Make weekly reviews, review scoreboard, understand why good/bad weeks happen and tune schedule to improve.
6. Be Lazy:
    - Give yourself idle time, freedom to truly rest your brain from the work-related thoughts. 
    - **[[Shutdown ritual]]** at the end of each work day
        - Conduct a daily review, transfer new tasks to lists, form the next day's schedule. Then clear your mind from all the obligations. Do not check e-mail or worry about the algorithm or proof. 
        - Ensure that for every incomplete task, you have either a plan that you trust for its completion, or you set up a reminder or captured it in a note that you know you will revisit when the time is right. 
        - When you're done, say "It is now safe to turn off your brain"
    - Just like willpower is a limited resource, so is attention (*attention fatigue*). Take walks in nature to replenish this resource: Attention Restoration Theory ^326c8a
    - The reason backed by research: "[[Zeigarnik effect]]": Incomplete tasks dominate our attention & subconscious, bring anxiety.
