A common mistake people make in analyzing tools is the "any-benefit" approach: People think they're justified to use a tool even if it has the potential for any possible benefit, without considering the downsides of using the tool, which include robbing time and attention. I think this is similar to the "fear of missing out (fomo)".

Instead, employ the "craftsman" approach, where you first identify the core factors for your own success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts significantly outweigh its negative impacts.  I repeat, don't fall into the fomo trap.

Very importantly for me, don't use the internet to entertain yourself: Quit refreshing the feed of reddit / youtube / facebook / instagram. The Pareto principle applies here as well: Follow a few select youtube channels for example, they will give you 80% of the benefits.

Put more thought into your leisure time. Do not default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, and spend hours on reddit/youtube. Rather, dedicate some thinking into how you want to spend your leisure time. Not only will this preserve your ability to resist distraction and concentrate, but you may, perhaps for the first time, appreciate what it means to "live, and not just exist". ^5b0edb
