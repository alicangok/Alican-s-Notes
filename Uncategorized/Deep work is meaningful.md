According to research in neurology, our brains construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. Spending the day buried in shallow tidbits, depressing news will reflect in how you perceive life.

According to research in psychology (ESM: experience sampling method), the best perceived moments occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish a difficult and worthwhile task. This mental state is called [[flow]]. Most people (self note: including me) falsely assume that relaxation makes them happy, but these ESM studies revealed the truth:

> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in oneâ€™s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

The experience of flow is a proven path to deep satisfaction.
