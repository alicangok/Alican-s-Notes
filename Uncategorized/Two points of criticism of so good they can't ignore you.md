### Passion hypothesis:

Newport makes a straw man argument for this, citing Bolles' book for the popularization of "follow your passion". However, that book does not focus on the passion, it actually advocates an alignment between "skills & knowledge" with "values & purpose".

Newport probably wanted a catchy argument to market his book. In any case, the persistence to develop skills, the deliberate practice for it definitely won't be possible without some form of purpose, some spark of passion. But it's important to keep in mind of the reality of the requirement of hard work, putting the hours.

So, it's probably best not to choose rigidly between "passion vs. skill" as Newport conveys, and better to support a tentative passion with developing skills.

### Specialization vs Generalization

Specializing early and spending all your time on one career may not be a good decision for long-term. Though Newport mentions the importance of "small bets", the book [[Range, Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World]] offers an alternative path to find a compelling career.

This [blog post](https://curtismchale.ca/2020/05/08/things-cal-newport-missed-in-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/) says that that book suggests to look at the places in which you show grit. Use the areas where you stick with hard things in the face of setbacks to help narrow down your focus and build value you can use to establish career capital.
