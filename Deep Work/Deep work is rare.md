The current work environment trend is open offices for constant availability and communication, mainly because communication is convenient and the contribution through deep work of individuals is not directly measurable. The author calls this "The Metric Black Hole".  Due to the principle of least resistance, people (and business cultures) tend towards the most convenient behavior, which is answering questions/emails promptly, and scheduling regular meeting for projects. However, this seriously degrades the concentration and the ability to work deep.

Feynman quote:
> To do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of time… it needs a lot of concentration… if you have a job administrating anything, you don’t have the time. So I have invented another myth for myself: that I’m irresponsible. I’m actively irresponsible. I tell everyone I don’t do anything. If anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, “no,” I tell them: I’m irresponsible.

Another part of the current business culture is that busyness is seen as a proxy for productivity; how visibly you work seems to be the defining metric (e.g. how quickly you respond to emails, attend meetings, etc), in the absence of clear goals.

For individuals embracing deep work, these biases are good news, since depth becomes increasingly rare, hence even more valuable.
