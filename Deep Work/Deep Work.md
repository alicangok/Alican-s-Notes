**Deep Work:** Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

The ability to perform Deep Work is [[Deep work is rare|rare]], it is [[Deep work is valuable|valuable]] in our economy, and it is [[Deep work is meaningful|meaningful]]. More importantly, "A deep life is a good life."

**Rules**:
- [[Work deeply]]: Form habits for deep work and keeping your brain relaxed.
- [[Embrace boredom]]: Stop your brain from craving distractions, schedule offline blocks.
- [[Quit social media]]: Put thought into your leisure time
- [[Drain the shallows]]: Schedule your day consciously

**Conclusion**:

"Deep work is *way more* powerful than most people understand". For example, Bill Gates founded a billion dollar industry with a semester's worth of deep work.

"To leave the distracted masses to join the focused few is a transformative experience". But, this transformation to deep life will not come easy, it requires hard work, and drastic changes to habits. It will also mean that you will have to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good. But if you're willing to face these fears and get out of your comfort zone, then you'll discover that this depth generates a rich life, full of productivity and meaning.
