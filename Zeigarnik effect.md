Incomplete tasks occupy our short-term memory until they are done. They thus distract us, dominate our attention & subconscious, bring anxiety, regardless of importance.

In order not to become a victim of this effect:
- Complete a [[Shutdown Ritual]] at the end of each work-day to relax during downtime.
- Divide a bigger tasks into small chunks, and devise written plan to finish these chunks to put our brain at ease ([[Separate and interlocking tasks]]), thus allowing us to concentrate on the task at hand.
