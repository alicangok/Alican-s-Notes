### Main Principles of Digital Minimalism

- Clutter is costly. Takes our time and attention.
- Optimization of benefits (diminshing returns, tradeoffs)
- Intentionality: Pursuit of meaning

### The Transformation Process:

Newport suggests a rapid, clear-cut transformation, as opposed to a gradual change. Because our initial inertia can fade when the remaning attention hogging digital thieves pull us back into the clutter.

Recommended declutter process:
- 30 days of break from optional technologies
- Meanwhile, explore and rediscover satisfying and meaningful activities
- After 30 days, consider carefully reintroducing optional technologies, by determining what value they add and how exactly you will use them to maximize this value.

Remember, do not think of this digital declutter as a detox experience. The goal is not to give yourself a break, it is to spark a permanent transformation of your digital life. (Note to self: Therefore "soft" time limits, on free-form browsing reddit or youtube may not achieve the desired outcome). Also, make sure that you replace your new found time with meaningful pursuits, otherwise the void can make life unpleasantly stale.

### Recommended Practices

- Spend time alone, with your own thoughts, free from input from other minds.
    - Leave home without phone, take long walks
    - Write letters to yourself: reflect, create, make plans
- Prefer conversation-centric communication over connection-centric comm.
    - More face-to-face conversations, more phone calls. Set "conversation office" hours.
    - Less text based conversations (see [[Asynchronous Communication]]), no "like"s at all.
- Reclaim leisure
    - Possibilities are endless: Training, playing instruments, carpentry, writing, reading
    - Strained, demaning effort can be a leisure activity: The brain is capable of it.
        - On the contrary, passive watching/browsing is more fatiguing.
    - Crafts: Produce valuable things in the physical world
        - Objects, sports, instruments, programming
    - Social leisure activities: Board Games, fitness, poker games
    - Strategize your free time. Make seasonal and weekly plans.
        - Identify objectives (goals & specific strategies) and habits (reading, attending cultural events, limiting a vice) every few months
        - Integrate the objectives and habits into detailed weekly plan (30 minute slots)
        - Fix/build something every week, join groups, schedule low-quality leisure blocks if you must
- Join the attention resistance
    - Delete social media from phone, dumb down your smartphone
    - Single-purpose computers: Block certain sites & apps
    - Use social-media like a professional: Separate accounts for different interests
    - Embrace slow media
        - Stop the autopilot shuffling of reddit/eksi/youtube/hurriyet)
        - Instead of following breaking news, follow next day articles by world class sources, journalists, thinkers
        - Ritualize this process: Choose location & set times
