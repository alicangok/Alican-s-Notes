### Applying [[Be so good they can't ignore you|Rule 2]]:

The course taking part of grad school requires deliberate practice and intellectual discomfort to expand your abilities. After this stage, if you are not careful, you are likely to plateau and stay at just an acceptable level. 

To overcome these plateaus, Newport introduced practical strategies to have deliberate practice in his daily routine.

Define structures for work, to combat internal resistance for discomfort
1) Time structure:
    - Tell yourself: "I am going to work on this for one hour, “I don’t care if I faint from the effort, or make no progress, for the next hour this is my whole world"
    - First minutes are hard, but eventually, you make progress.
    - Time limit makes the process managable.
 2) Information structure:
     - Create maps of dependencies
     - Short self-quizzes
     - Summaries in own words

Research bible routine:
- Once a week, summarize a "bible" paper, relevant to research
    - Description of result
    - Comparison to previous work
    - Main strategies

Hour-tally routine:
- Sheet, with a row for each month
- Total number of hours in a state of deliberate practice.

A $45 lab notebook: [[Work deeply#^7cf884|a grand gesture]]
- Record results of brainstorming sessions
- Forces collecting and organizing thinking: More deliberate practice

The insights of [[Be so good they can't ignore you|Rule 2]] transformed his "productivity-centric" mindset to "craft-centric". Instead of just getting things done, you spend time for deliberate practice.

### Applying [[Turn down a promotion|Rule 3]]:

Newport describes why he chose Georgetown over other universities for the tenure track. In short, they allowed him more flexibility in his research, and clear criteria for the eventual tenure decision, hence giving him more "control".

### Applying [[Think small, act big|Rule 4]]:

Besides career capital, which requires patience, you need to be always scanning the adjacent possible in your field, looking for the next big idea. This requires a dedication to brainstorming and exposure to new ideas. These two commitments describe a lifestyle, not a series of defined steps that output a mission automatically.

The three-level pyramid of routines he developed:
- Top-level: Tentative Research Mission, Rough guideline
    - "To apply x to interesting places for interesting results"
 - Bottom-level: Background Research ^3cb114
     - Every week, learn something new within field
     - Read a paper, attend a talk, schedule a meeting
     - To ensure understanding: Summarize in own words -> Research bible
     - Brainstorm, perhaps while walking
 - Middle-level: Exploratory Projects
     - "Little bets", maximum 2-3 at a time
     - Use deadlines, not more than 1-2 months
     - Track hours spent, helps accountability.
     - Two-fold benefit:
         - Concrete feedback, whether the direction is good
         - Induces deliberate practice
     - Over time, the research mission evolves, gets clearer.

A passage regarding grad school:

> Graduate school, and the postdoctoral years that often follow, provide an uneven growth experience. Early in this process you’re constantly pushed into intellectual discomfort. A graduate-level mathematics problem set—something I have plenty of experience with—is about as pure an exercise in deliberate practice as you’re likely to find. You’re given a problem that you have no idea how to solve, but you have to solve it or you’ll get a bad grade, so you dive in and try as hard as you can, repeatedly failing as different avenues lead you to dead ends. The mental strain of mustering every last available neuron toward solving a problem, driven by the fear of earning zero points on the assignment, is a nice encapsulation of exactly what the deliberate-practice literature says is necessary to improve. This is why, early in their careers, graduate students experience great leaps in their abilities.
> But at a research-oriented program like the one offered by MIT’s computer science department, your course work winds down after the first two years. Soon after, your research efforts are expected to release themselves from your advisor’s orbit and follow a self-directed trajectory. It’s here that if you’re not careful to keep pushing forward, your improvement can taper off to what the performance scientist Anders Ericsson called an “acceptable level,” where you then remain stuck.”
