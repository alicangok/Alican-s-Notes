### Clarity of the craftsman

Craftsman Mindset:
- There is no shortcut to success. Eventually the experience exudes confidence.
- Stop focusing on the little details, focus on becoming better: [[Work deeply#^f1cc1d|Keep a scoreboard]]
- Focus on the value you're offering the world.

Passion Mindset:
 - Focusing on what work offers you makes you hyperaware of what you don't like about it. Leads to chronic unhappiness.
 - Deep questions "Who am I", "what do I love" are impossible to confirm 
 
Don't just envy people, emulate the craftsman mindset. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it. Passion will follow after adopting the craftsman mindset as you make progress.

### Power of career capital

Career capital theory of great work:
- The traits that define great work are rare and valuable:
    - Creativity
    - Impact
    - Control
- If you want these traits, you need to offer rare and valuable skills: career capital
- The craftsman mindset strategy is well suited to acquire this career capital

This is a purely pragmatic argument, not a philosopy debate on passion or hard work.

*Courage culture* says "Your biggest obstacle between you and the work you love is lack of courage". This is extremely superficial, and misses the requirement of developing skills to succeed.

These being said, if you are stuck in a job with little opportunities to distinguish yourself, if you view the job as useless or unethical, or if it forces you to work with people you dislike, then by all means switch to another field.

### Career capitalists

If you examine breakthroughs in people's careers, you'll see that they're the result of accumulations of directed efforts, perhaps along with some external chance factors.

When starting out, even if you don't exactly know how you're gonna use your career capital, it may shape itself as you go on, or opportunities may simply arise when people hear about your career capital.

### Becoming a craftsman

Be comfortable with mental discomfort. Keep in mind the 10,000 hour rule, with the hours spent on deliberate practice (see [[Outliers]]), that is systematically stretching your abilities.

Important quote:
"Most fields, like being a knowledge worker, don't have a clear training philosophy. If you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your value, not get stuck in plateaus. Deliberate practice might provide the key to quickly becoming so good they canâ€™t ignore you"

How to accomplish **deliberate practice**:
1. Decide what capital market you're in: Winner-take-all vs. Auction
    - Winner-take-all market: one type of career capital, single ability
    - auction market: each person may have a unique collection
2. Identify the specific type of capital to pursue
     - Seek open gates, quick capital building opportunities
3. Define "Good"
     - Deliberate practice requires clear, good goals
4. Stretch and destroy
    - Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, this is not deliberate practice.
    - Deliberate practice is an effort of focus and concentration. It may be the opposite of enjoyable.
    - If you're not uncomfortable, then you're probably stuck at an acceptable level.
    - Opinions of others count. Embrace feedback.
5. Be patient
     - It will take time before people start to notice.
