If your goal is to love what you do:
- Following idealized, vague passions are dangerous, they lead to unsatisfaction & anxiety. Career passions take time to develop, they are a side effect of mastery.
- **Achieve mastery:** You need to be good at something valuable and rare before you can expect a good job: Deliberate Practice to develop your career capital
- **Invest your capital in traits:** This mastery by itself is not enough to guarantee happiness. The molding of your "career capital" into the right traits is necessary: Creativity, Impact, Control, Mission, etc.
    - **Gain control:** Once you have enough career capital, think of gaining control of your working life, challenge your employers.
    - **Work on a mission:** Eventually, identify and work on your mission. Explore, execute, publish, market. 

Rule 1: [[Don't follow your passion]]
Rule 2: [[Be so good they can't ignore you]] - The importance of skill
Rule 3: [[Turn down a promotion]] - The importance of control
Rule 4: [[Think small,Â act big]] - The importance of mission
